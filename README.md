Use local Wallpaper Engine Workshop files on macOS.

Workshop Wallpaper Bridge imports a copied Wallpaper Engine Workshop folder into a private Mac library and plays supported wallpapers on the desktop layer. It is built for files you already have locally. It does not talk to Steam, download Workshop items, or modify the copied Workshop folder.

## Download

Download the latest `WorkshopWallpaperBridge-macOS-arm64.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/3x-haust/workshop-wallpaper-bridge/releases).

1. Open the DMG.
2. Drag **Workshop Wallpaper Bridge.app** to **Applications**.
3. Open the app. It runs as a menu bar utility, not a Dock app.

Public releases are Developer ID signed, notarized, and Gatekeeper-checked with download quarantine applied before upload. If macOS reports that a downloaded release is damaged, use the next release and file an issue with the macOS version and release tag.

The app checks GitHub Releases for updates automatically when **Auto-check Updates** is enabled. Use **Check Updates** from the settings window, or **Check for Updates** from the menu bar menu, to check manually. When a newer release exists, **Download Update** downloads the latest DMG.

## Use It

For Wallpaper Engine projects:

1. On Windows, locate the Workshop folder:

   ```text
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\431960
   ```

2. Copy the `431960` folder to your Mac.
3. Open **Workshop Wallpaper Bridge Settings** from the menu bar icon.
4. Click **Browse**, choose the copied `431960` folder, then click **Scan**.
5. Select a supported item and click **Import Selected**.
6. Click **Play on Desktop**.

For your own videos, click **Add Video File** instead of scanning a Workshop folder.

Display modes:

- **Fit** keeps the full wallpaper visible.
- **Fill** covers the screen and may crop edges.
- **Stretch** fills the screen exactly and may distort the image.

Playback notes:

- Playback runs continuously by default to avoid Dock and Space transition flicker.
- **Auto-pause behind apps** is optional.
- Closing the settings window does not stop playback.
- **Open at Login** restores the last played wallpaper after login.
- **Play on Desktop** does not change the macOS desktop picture, so the translucent menu bar keeps using your current system wallpaper tint.
- Use **Set Still Wallpaper** only when you explicitly want to replace the macOS desktop and Lock Screen still image.
- **Remove** deletes the imported Mac-library copy only. It does not touch the original copied folder or video.

Library rotation:

- Turn on **Rotate Library** to automatically cycle through every playable wallpaper in your Mac library on a timer.
- **Shuffle** randomizes the order, **Rotate Every** sets the interval (30s, 1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h), and **Next** jumps to the next wallpaper immediately.
- Rotation is available in both the settings window and the menu bar menu. The on/off state, shuffle, and interval are remembered across launches and resume after login.
- **Play on Desktop** or **Stop** turns rotation off so manual selection always wins. Non-playable items are skipped automatically.

Imported files are stored in:

```text
~/Library/Application Support/WorkshopWallpaperBridge
```

## What Works

| Project type | Support |
| --- | --- |
| `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.m4v` video | Plays directly |
| `.webm`, `.mkv`, `.avi` video | Converts locally with `ffmpeg`, then plays |
| `index.html` web wallpaper | Plays in a restricted local WebView |
| `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.heic` image | Displays as a static desktop layer |
| `scene.pkg` scene wallpaper | Uses the native scene renderer first; supports packed 2D image layers, animated sprite-sheet textures, text-only scenes, selected SceneScript snippets, keyframed motion, selected water/scroll shaders, and simple layer effects |

Scene support is conservative. The app renders supported scene features directly instead of claiming full Wallpaper Engine runtime compatibility.

Supported scene features include:

- Packed `.tex` textures, LZ4 blocks, and common DXT formats.
- Text layers and selected text SceneScript `update(value)` snippets.
- Keyframed position, scale, rotation, and opacity.
- Mirror-mode keyframe animations as ping-pong loops.
- Animated sprite-sheet (`texgif`) textures from `TEXS0001`-`TEXS0003` frame containers.
- Selected `waterFlow`, `waterWaves`, `waterRipple`, and `scroll` shader motion from package constants.
- Simple `shake`, `spin`, and `shine` layer effects when they can be represented safely.
- Puppet-warp models (`MDLV0013`) with decoded mesh, bones, mirror-mode bone animations, and CPU skinning.
- Approximate `nitro`-style glint effects and simple sprite or pulse-ring particle systems.

Still limited or unsupported:

- Embedded MP4 video textures.
- Complex particle operators.
- Masked effect composition.
- Audio-reactive scripts.
- Object or scene API scripts.
- Full custom shader pipelines.
- Media integration.

`wwbctl attach-scene-video <asset-id> <video-file>` stores a local reference cache inside the private Mac library for diagnostics or comparison workflows. It does not replace the scene renderer.

The package analyzer preserves scene runtime requirements such as effect files, shader files, shader uniforms, SceneScript, particles, sound layers, audio-analysis inputs, and video textures so renderer-engine parity work can be targeted.

Workshop preview files such as `preview.jpg`, `thumbnail.jpg`, and `cover.png` are treated as thumbnails. If a project contains `scene.pkg`, the app reads the packed scene data instead of stretching a low-resolution preview across the screen.

## Screen Saver

Turn on **Animate Screen Saver** to install and select the bundled macOS screen saver for the current Mac host.

What animates in the screen saver:

- MP4, MOV, and M4V wallpapers from the Mac library.
- Local videos added with **Add Video File**.

What uses a still fallback:

- WebM, MKV, and AVI before conversion.
- Web wallpapers.
- Scene wallpapers.

macOS still controls when the screen saver starts. Configure the start time and password timing in System Settings > Lock Screen. Until macOS starts the selected screen saver, the normal static Lock Screen wallpaper is shown.

The app can also set a still desktop wallpaper explicitly with **Set Still Wallpaper**. For MP4, MOV, and M4V files, it extracts a frame from the video instead of using a small Workshop preview. **Play on Desktop** intentionally leaves the macOS desktop picture alone; this avoids surprising menu bar tint changes while animated playback is running.

## Build From Source

Requirements:

- macOS 14 or newer
- Xcode command line tools
- Swift 6 toolchain
- Optional: `ffmpeg` for WebM, MKV, and AVI conversion

```bash
git clone https://github.com/3x-haust/workshop-wallpaper-bridge.git
cd workshop-wallpaper-bridge
swift run WorkshopWallpaperBridge
```

Build a local app bundle and DMG:

```bash
bash Scripts/package-app.sh
open "dist/Workshop Wallpaper Bridge.app"
```

The script writes:

```text
dist/WorkshopWallpaperBridge-macOS-arm64.dmg
```

Install `ffmpeg`:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

## CLI

`wwbctl` is included for scanning, importing, conversion, and scene diagnostics:

```bash
swift run wwbctl scan "/path/to/431960" --out index.json
swift run wwbctl import "/path/to/431960"
swift run wwbctl import-video "/path/to/video.mp4"
swift run wwbctl remove "<asset-id>"
swift run wwbctl convert input.webm --out output.mp4
swift run wwbctl scene-info "/path/to/scene.pkg"
swift run wwbctl scene-render-info "/path/to/scene.pkg"
swift run wwbctl scene-engine-info "/path/to/scene.pkg"
swift run wwbctl doctor
```

For signed public releases, set `SIGN_IDENTITY`, `NOTARY_PROFILE`, `REQUIRE_SIGNING=1`, and `REQUIRE_NOTARIZATION=1` before running `Scripts/package-app.sh`. The release workflow also requires the `MACOS_DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION_CERTIFICATE_BASE64`, `MACOS_DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `MACOS_NOTARY_APPLE_ID`, `MACOS_NOTARY_TEAM_ID`, and `MACOS_NOTARY_PASSWORD` GitHub Secrets.

## Troubleshooting

Nothing appears on the desktop:

- Check that the imported item is marked `playable`.
- Press **Stop**, then **Play on Desktop** again.
- Temporarily turn off **Auto-pause behind apps**.
- Make sure you are viewing the desktop, not a full-screen app Space.

The wallpaper looks blurry or cropped:

- Use **Fit** to keep the full image or video visible.
- Use **Fill** to cover the screen and accept edge cropping.
- For `scene.pkg` items, check whether the scene uses unsupported particles, advanced scripts, shaders, or video textures.

WebM, MKV, or AVI conversion fails:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Workshop Wallpaper Bridge** does not appear in Screen Saver settings:

- Open the packaged `.app`, not only `swift run`.
- Turn on **Animate Screen Saver** once.
- Check that `~/Library/Screen Savers/Workshop Wallpaper Bridge.saver` exists.
- Quit and reopen System Settings if the list does not refresh.

The screen saver preview is black:

- Install the latest release.
- Toggle **Animate Screen Saver** off and on again.
- Click **Screen Saver Settings** once so the app reinstalls and reselects the bundled saver.

## Project Boundaries

Workshop Wallpaper Bridge is local-only.
